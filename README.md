# Tourism Trend in European countries

# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

The wealth of european culture, variety of landscapes and the quality of infrastructures makes Europe one of the major tourist destinations. Tourism is one of the most rapidly growing global industries. At the mean time, tourism forecasting is becoming an increasingly important activity in planning and managing the industry. Our project idea is to investigate the tourism industry in European countries. Tourism is economically important for the development of a country in EU regions. Our goal is to investigate the tourism nature and if there are certain factors affecting the popularity of the countries as a touristic place. We will use a variety of small datasets offered by the EU(https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database), mainly focusing on the datasets under "Database by themes > Industry, trade and services > Tourism (tour) > Monthly data on tourism industries" sections. 

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 

* How has tourism trends shifted throughout the years?
* What variation occurs between months of the year in tourism rates, interest in tourism, and its effects on the industry?
* How volatile is the job market in the tourism sector?
* Do people prefer to travel to cheaper places? How does prices in the country affect its attractiveness to travelers?

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

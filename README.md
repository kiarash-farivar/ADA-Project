The wealth of european culture, variety of landscapes and the quality of infrastructures makes Europe one of the major tourist destinations. Tourism is one of the most rapidly growing global industries. At the mean time, tourism forecasting is becoming an increasingly important activity in planning and managing the industry. Our project idea is to investigate the tourism industry in European countries. Tourism is economically important for the development of a country in EU regions. Our goal is to investigate the tourism nature and if there are certain factors affecting the popularity of the countries as a touristic place. We will use a variety of small datasets offered by the EU(https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database), mainly focusing on the datasets under "Database by themes > Industry, trade and services > Tourism (tour) > Monthly data on tourism industries" sections.
